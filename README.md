## Research context

We are conducting a study on the effects of a peculiar substance called 'Monopozine' found in everyday food items on the performance of individuals playing the popular board game Monopoly. Monopozine is a fictional compound known for its supposed ability to enhance strategic thinking and luck in competitive settings (of course I am making this up for pedagogical reasons). In this study, we recruit a group of Monopoly players and ask them to keep track of their game results over the course of a week. Each participant records the number of wins and losses they experience while playing Monopoly, as well as their weekly consumption of Monopozine.
